# IPMI Package Samples

This directory contains various sample implementations of modules and libraries
that demonstrate common usage of the IPMI components, but may not be suitable
for direct usage. Often this is because the ultimate functionality of the code
is very platform specific and is not suitable for a generalize implementation.
Instead, platforms consumers may wish to copy or use this code as reference for
their own implementations.

**IPMI Status Reporter** - This module is a sample for using the generic Status
Code reporting mechanism in UEFI for logging events to the SEL.
